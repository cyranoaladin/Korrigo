# Bandit Security Scanner Configuration
# https://bandit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config.html

# Viatique Security Policy:
# - Production code: Strict scanning (all checks enabled)
# - Test code: Scanned but with known false positives suppressed via # nosec
# - Management commands: Scanned with env var validation enforced

# Directories to exclude from scanning
exclude_dirs:
  - .venv
  - venv
  - staticfiles
  - __pycache__
  - migrations  # Django migrations are auto-generated
  - .pytest_cache

# Tests to skip globally (use sparingly - prefer targeted # nosec)
# Currently: None - we suppress false positives via targeted # nosec comments

# Severity levels to report (Medium and High are CI-blocking)
# Low: Informational only, does not block CI
tests:

# Plugin allowlist (empty = all plugins enabled)
# We want strict scanning on production code
plugins:

# Baseline file for tracking known issues over time
# Not used currently - we fix issues as they appear
# baseline: bandit-baseline.json
